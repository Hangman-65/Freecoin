MinGW32 cross-compilation instructions

written by Denis Roio <jaromil@dyne.org>
testing contributed by Matt Corallo <matt@bluematt.me>


Install mingw32 (on Debian and Ubuntu, may have a different name on
other distros)

The following will cross compile on Ubuntu.  Other distros will need
more testing, but this should be a good example.  On Fedora,
the relevant mingw configure scripts might help.

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
	    --with-wx-prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/ \
	    --with-boost=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc \
	    --with-boost-thread=boost_thread_win32-mt-s \
	    --with-boost-program-options=boost_program_options-mt-s \
	    --with-boost-filesystem=boost_filesystem-mt-s \
	    --with-boost-system=boost_system-mt-s

Where one should substitute '/usr/i586-mingw32msvc' with the path to
the libraries and include directories of mingw.

If all goes well with the configure detection then you can run

make

which should produce bitcoin (if WX GUI was selected) 
and bitcoind (background daemon)
